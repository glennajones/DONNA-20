Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight router)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, React Context for auth
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Build Tool**: Vite with TypeScript support

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL database with proper connection pooling
- **API**: RESTful endpoints with proper error handling

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **JWT-based authentication** with 7-day token expiration
- **Role-based access control** with three roles: admin, manager, coach
- **Password hashing** using bcrypt for security
- **Protected routes** with automatic redirects to login
- **Persistent sessions** using localStorage

### User Interface
- **Responsive design** optimized for desktop and mobile
- **Dark/light theme support** through CSS variables
- **Component library** using shadcn/ui for consistency
- **Form handling** with proper validation
- **Toast notifications** for user feedback

### Database Schema
- **Users table** with id, username, password, name, and role fields
- **Registrations table** with player information, contact details, emergency contacts, medical info, and status tracking
- **Payments table** with registration fee tracking, payment status, and Stripe integration support
- **PostgreSQL dialect** configured for production use
- **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe database operations
- **Migration system** for schema changes

### Module Architecture

#### Module 1: Authentication & User Management
- **JWT-based authentication** with secure login/logout
- **Role-based access control** (Admin, Manager, Coach)
- **Protected routes** with automatic redirects
- **User profile management**

#### Module 2: Registration & Payment System
- **Public registration form** for new players and parents
- **Registration management dashboard** for admins/managers
- **Payment tracking** with fee calculation
- **Status workflow** (pending â†’ approved/rejected)
- **Registration data validation** with comprehensive form handling
- **Demo payment processing** with mock Stripe integration

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - User submits login credentials
   - Server validates against user database
   - JWT token generated and returned with user data
   - Token stored in localStorage and included in API requests
   - Protected routes check for valid token

2. **API Request Flow**:
   - Frontend makes API requests through queryClient
   - Authentication middleware validates JWT tokens
   - Business logic processes requests
   - Responses include proper error handling

3. **State Management**:
   - Auth state managed through React Context
   - Server state cached with TanStack Query
   - UI state managed with React hooks

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management and caching
- **@radix-ui/***: Headless UI primitives for accessibility
- **wouter**: Lightweight client-side routing
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **react-hook-form**: Form handling and validation
- **date-fns**: Date manipulation utilities

### Backend Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL database driver
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe ORM for PostgreSQL
- **bcrypt**: Password hashing library
- **jsonwebtoken**: JWT token generation and validation
- **express**: Web application framework

### Development Dependencies
- **vite**: Build tool and dev server
- **typescript**: Type checking and compilation
- **drizzle-kit**: Database migration tools
- **esbuild**: Backend bundling for production

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Vite dev server** for frontend hot reloading
- **tsx** for running TypeScript backend directly
- **PostgreSQL database** with demo data seeding
- **Environment variables** for configuration

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite builds optimized React bundle to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- **Static serving**: Express serves built frontend assets
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling

### Environment Configuration
- **DATABASE_URL**: PostgreSQL connection string
- **JWT_SECRET**: Secret key for token signing
- **NODE_ENV**: Environment mode (development/production)

### Database Management
- **Drizzle migrations** stored in `./migrations` directory
- **Schema definition** in `./shared/schema.ts`
- **Push commands** for schema synchronization
- **Type safety** through Drizzle's TypeScript integration

The application is designed to be easily deployable to platforms like Replit, with proper separation of concerns and environment-specific configurations.
