- **Notification bell system** with real-time alerts for incoming replies
- **Reply message display** in chat interface with source identification
- **Webhook endpoints** ready for production integration (/api/webhook/sms, /api/webhook/email)

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - User submits login credentials
   - Server validates against user database
   - JWT token generated and returned with user data
   - Token stored in localStorage and included in API requests
   - Protected routes check for valid token

2. **API Request Flow**:
   - Frontend makes API requests through queryClient
   - Authentication middleware validates JWT tokens
   - Business logic processes requests
   - Responses include proper error handling

3. **State Management**:
   - Auth state managed through React Context
   - Server state cached with TanStack Query
   - UI state managed with React hooks

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management and caching
- **@radix-ui/***: Headless UI primitives for accessibility
- **wouter**: Lightweight client-side routing
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **react-hook-form**: Form handling and validation
- **date-fns**: Date manipulation utilities

### Backend Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL database driver
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe ORM for PostgreSQL
- **bcrypt**: Password hashing library
- **jsonwebtoken**: JWT token generation and validation
- **express**: Web application framework

### Development Dependencies
- **vite**: Build tool and dev server
- **typescript**: Type checking and compilation
- **drizzle-kit**: Database migration tools
- **esbuild**: Backend bundling for production

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Vite dev server** for frontend hot reloading
- **tsx** for running TypeScript backend directly
- **PostgreSQL database** with demo data seeding
- **Environment variables** for configuration

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite builds optimized React bundle to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- **Static serving**: Express serves built frontend assets
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling

### Environment Configuration
- **DATABASE_URL**: PostgreSQL connection string
- **JWT_SECRET**: Secret key for token signing
- **NODE_ENV**: Environment mode (development/production)

### Database Management
- **Drizzle migrations** stored in `./migrations` directory
- **Schema definition** in `./shared/schema.ts`
- **Push commands** for schema synchronization
- **Type safety** through Drizzle's TypeScript integration

The application is designed to be easily deployable to platforms like Replit, with proper separation of concerns and environment-specific configurations.
