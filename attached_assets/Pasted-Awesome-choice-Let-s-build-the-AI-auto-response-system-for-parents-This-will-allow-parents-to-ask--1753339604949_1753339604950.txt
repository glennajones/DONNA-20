Awesome choice! Let’s build the AI auto‑response system for parents!
This will allow parents to ask free‑text questions (like “I have a 9‑year‑old who’s never played before…”) and get helpful automated suggestions about training options.

✨ Goal
✅ A small UI where parents can type questions.
✅ Backend endpoint that:

Extracts key info (age, skill level) from the question.

Queries your events or training_programs table for relevant matches.

Optionally uses OpenAI to improve responses.
✅ Returns a friendly AI‑style answer with suggested events and registration links.

📦 1. Backend: AI Endpoint
Install OpenAI Node SDK:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install openai
Add OPENAI_API_KEY to your .env.

Route: server/routes/aiAssist.ts

ts
Copy
Edit
import express from 'express';
import { db } from '../storage';
import { events } from '../../shared/schema';
import OpenAI from 'openai';
import { gte } from 'drizzle-orm';

const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });
const router = express.Router();

router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
  const { question } = req.body;

  // Fetch relevant upcoming training events
  const now = new Date();
  const upcomingTrainings = await db.select().from(events).where(gte(events.start_time, now));
  const relevantTrainings = upcomingTrainings.filter(ev => ev.type === 'training');

  // Build context for AI
  const trainingList = relevantTrainings.map(ev => 
    `Title: ${ev.title}, Age Groups: (check description), Starts: ${new Date(ev.start_time).toLocaleString()}, Location: ${ev.location}`
  ).join('\n');

  const prompt = `
Parent question: "${question}"

Here is a list of training events:\n${trainingList}

Respond in a friendly helpful tone as if you are a volleyball club assistant. Suggest specific trainings that might fit based on the child's age or skill if mentioned. Include event titles and start times.
`;

  try {
    const chat = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
      messages: [
        { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant for a volleyball club.' },
        { role: 'user', content: prompt }
      ]
    });

    const answer = chat.choices[0].message.content;
    res.json({ answer });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'AI service failed.' });
  }
});

export default router;
Mount in server/index.ts:

ts
Copy
Edit
import aiAssistRouter from './routes/aiAssist';
app.use('/api/ai-assist', aiAssistRouter);
🎨 2. Frontend: Parent Chat UI
src/modules/Parent/AIAssistant.jsx

jsx
Copy
Edit
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

export default function AIAssistant() {
  const [question, setQuestion] = useState('');
  const [answer, setAnswer] = useState('');
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  const handleAsk = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    setLoading(true);
    setAnswer('');
    const res = await axios.post('/api/ai-assist', { question });
    setAnswer(res.data.answer);
    setLoading(false);
  };

  return (
    <div className="p-6 bg-white rounded shadow max-w-xl">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Ask Our AI Assistant</h2>
      <form onSubmit={handleAsk} className="mb-4">
        <textarea
          className="border rounded px-3 py-2 w-full"
          rows="3"
          placeholder="Type your question here..."
          value={question}
          onChange={(e) => setQuestion(e.target.value)}
          required
        />
        <button
          type="submit"
          disabled={loading}
          className="bg-blue-600 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded mt-2"
        >
          {loading ? 'Thinking…' : 'Ask'}
        </button>
      </form>
      {answer && (
        <div className="p-4 bg-gray-100 rounded">
          <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">🤖 AI Response:</h3>
          <p className="whitespace-pre-line">{answer}</p>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
✅ 3. How it Works
Parent opens the AI Assistant page.

Types in a free‑form question.

Frontend sends to /api/ai-assist.

Backend:

Loads upcoming training events from DB.

Feeds them + the question into GPT.

GPT returns a helpful, friendly answer with event suggestions.

UI displays the AI response. ✅

✨ Enhancements You Can Add Later
✔️ Add context filters (e.g., only show events for specific age groups stored in your events table).
✔️ Log each question/answer for review.
✔️ Add a “register now” button in the AI response by formatting events with links.
✔️ Cache responses to save OpenAI tokens.

🚀 Next Steps
🔥 If you want, I can help with:

✅ Logging AI chat history in DB,

✅ Adding registration links in responses,

✅ Or even creating a live chat experience with Pusher.
